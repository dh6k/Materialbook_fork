> [!NOTE]
> I'm sorry this update has taken multiple months.
>
> The Material You script was not good enough to publish by my standards
> (even when it did get the job done), so as I got better I did a full rewrite
> and made it 4x shorter and increased the coverage.

> [!TIP]
> Did you find a place that isn't AMOLED Black or Material You? Comment

>
> Or maybe you're dissatisfied with the lack of translations for some elements? Help
> me get everything translated by commenting in
> [this discussion](https://github.com/eepiemi/Materialbook/discussions/2).
> Any help with the large amount of gaps that are present will be HIGHLY APPRECIATED!!
>
> Or you just have an issue? File an issue [here](https://github.com/eepiemi/Materialbook/issues/new/choose).
> I can't guarantee I'll be able to fix it with my current Kotlin + Jetpack Compose skills though 😅
